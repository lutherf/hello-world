        <h3>About Me</h3>

        <p>I am currently pursuing my MBA and MS in Design Innovation through Northwestern's MMM program, a collaborative dual-degree program between the Kellogg School of Management and the McCormick School of Engineering.</p>

            <p>Prior to Kellogg, I was a Strategy & Analytics consultant at Deloitte with experience implementing Data, Analytics and Business Transformation initiatives for Fortune 500 clients.</p>
            
            A selection of my professional experiences include:
            <ul>
            <li>Designing a data platform for a credit card securitization program</li>
            <li>Supporting a global finance transformation for a major FinTech company</li>
            <li>Implementing a profitability and cross-sell analytical application for a major global bank</li>
            <li>Prototyping a data visualization tool to trace lineage of regulatory report line items to source systems</li>
            <li>Assessing a bank's regulatory data environment for CCAR and BCBS 239 readiness</li>
           </ul>

            <p>I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin where I earned bachelor's degrees in Management Information Systems and Plan II (UTâ€™s interdisciplinary liberal arts honors program). My diverse course load included classes in finance, accounting, philosophy, world literature and programming. For my senior thesis, I wrote about the socioeconomic background of NBA players and the origin of the "hoop dreams" myth. </p>
